<h1 >What makes our restaurant effective?</h1>
<p>A good restaurant description needs to make a strong first impression on would-be diners. This means the writing should be grammatically sound and typo-free — but it also means the content should make strategic sense for your brand. There are several keys to doing this correctly:

Define your objective. As you'll see in the examples below, descriptions that work for some restaurants would fall flat for others. A cocktail lounge might want its description to be a call to adventure, while a sandwich shop might simply want to say it has the lowest prices in town. Define the main thing you want your audience to know or feel, then use that as a north star to guide your writing.

Outline key points. Now that you know your objective, write down all the key messages you want to communicate. Sort them into tiers of importance, and be honest about what is "nice to know" versus what is "need to know." Digital attention spans are short, so if you try to include every selling point — rather than just the essentials — readers will gloss over your description. The more information you ask them to retain, the less they actually will.

Consider the visuals. As you determine the best way to communicate "need to know" messages, remember that text is not the only way to communicate. Many of the examples below use design and photography to reinforce their key selling points. This reduces how much text you need and helps solve the attention span issue mentioned above, but to do it correctly across devices, you'll need a well-designed website platform.

Edit & ask for feedback. There's a famous saying in the writing industry: "writing is rewriting." In other words, your first draft always needs work, and the real craft of writing comes in making that first draft better. When you have something down, read it over for typos but also play around with different word choices and sentence structures. Ask people you trust for feedback. If you do this well, you'll only have to do it once. It's worth investing a little extra time.

The examples below are designed to help with this process. It may be helpful to bookmark this page and refer to them while you write and edit. Or, you can view them all now and see if any stand out as starting points.

<h2>How we provide the best quality to our customers?</h2>
<p>Online Restaurant Website” is considered as an increasingly used application in restaurant management. Just a few years ago, people used to spend long time waiting for a table to be ready for them at a restaurant. And after that, they would wait longer time to order their food. There was no surprise that the food took too long to be prepared. In short, the whole enjoyment of eating did eventually result in boredom and tiredness for customers. From another side, this is the restaurant management and staff who used to stand much pressure to handle a lot of customers at the same time. With great technology in general and the internet in specific, customers can be happy by using online food ordering and reservation. This facilitates the work of restaurant managers and staff. The system will make the entire process for the restaurant manager much easier and faster compared with traditional methods. On the other hand, these days’ customers can place their orders and make their reservations as quickly and enjoyably as a click on their computers or smart devices.</p>

<h3>How we manage each and every thing in a very systematic way?</h3>
<p>Managing journalists is especially challenging. We hire them for their ability to question authority and resist spin. And then they apply those same skills when dealing with — us. They challenge managers, look skeptically at our decisions, and even mock our memos. 

And yet, we love them, largely because we behaved the same way when we were frontline staffers. 

Now, during this unprecedented time in history — and in journalism —leaders must show the love in ways big and small. That requires messages of appreciation, encouragement, support, concern – and yes, inspiration. 

I’m always on the alert for good examples — and I share them with care. Since the best leaders don’t want to appear self-promotional, I promise them I’ll make it clear — the spotlight on their work was my idea. 

So let’s look at some effective short and long form messages from supervisors.  Their most important quality is authenticity. No management-speak, b.s., or blather. Their purpose is clear and tailored for the moment. Recipients think: “That’s just the kind of thing she’d say. And I like it.” 


In our first example, the “she” is Mary Glendinning, NPR’s deputy chief of the RAD (Research, Archives and Data Strategy) team. Mary is serious about research, has a low-key, clever sense of humor and is one of the rare people I know who shares my love of Scandinavian salted licorice. 

Mary’s team is accustomed to working behind-the-scenes at NPR. But now, working from home, they’re just as busy, but more distant from the daily buzz and from each other</p>
<h4> What is our first and last purpose is to make people's satisy?</h4>
<P>These are complicated questions and the answers would be long. In short I would say managing any workforce requires good communications between the employees and the employer. To accomplish this you need to share your visions —-what and how you want your restaurant to grow and accomplish certain goals (e.g. profit)—with your employees. Then you need to build honest relationship with them so they can trust you. Last, you develop a set of rules that includes what to do and what not to do within your restaurant. You would also need to check these rules from time to time. If they’re no working properly, you need to adjust accordingly.</P>
